Pytheas is a tool that aims to introduce a new mentality in shear-wave splitting analysis from local recordings, incorporating manual, semi- and fully- automatic methods under one Graphical User Interface. Integrating databases and offering compatibility with popular data and metadata file formats, Pytheas is designed with the simplification of analysis in mind, while, at the same time, enhanching the effectiveness of processing and quality control of results.

Along with the program itself, you can find the following files:

* *docs:* Contains a detailed User's Guide as well as other relevant documentation.
* *acquisition_scripts:* Scripts for acquiring event data and metadata, as well as station metadata from EIDA and IRIS FDSN services.
* *example:* Sample waveforms, catalogues, station file and velocity model for trying out the program.

Pytheas is released under the GNU GPLv3 license.
