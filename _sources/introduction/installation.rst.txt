Installation
============
Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Pytheas has been tested on various systems running Windows 10, using Python 3.7.2. The program has been tested on the following versions of individual packages:

 * obspy 1.1.1
 * PyQt5 5.11.3
 * scikit-learn 0.20.2
 * matplotlib 3.0.2
 * numpy 1.16.0
 * scipy 1.2.0

Dependencies and Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To use Pytheas you first need to install `Python 3 <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ and then the following dependencies:

* obspy
* PyQt5
* scikit-learn
* configparser

You can use the provided scripts to install dependencies. For Windows users this is ``install_reqs_windows.bat`` and for Linux users ``install_reqs_linux.sh``.

Alternatively, you can install the packages by ``pip`` using the following commands in a terminal (Linux/MacOS) or command prompt (Windows): 

|  ``pip install obspy``
|  ``pip install PyQt5``
|  ``pip install scikit-learn`` 
|  ``pip install configparser``

Remember to also update ``numpy``, ``scipy`` and ``matplotlib``:

|  ``pip install --upgrade numpy``
|  ``pip install --upgrade scipy``
|  ``pip install --upgrade matplotlib``

Another option is using a distribution like `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/>`_.

No matter which one of the above you prefer, the program runs by using the ``LaunchPytheas.pyw`` file. Windows users can use ``LaunchPytheas.exe`` instead.

System Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hardware requirements are largely dependent on the analyzed waveforms. We tested Pytheas on four different systems with the following results.

*User Experience is based on subjective criteria, among three different analysts.*

A dedicated GPU is generally recommended, especially if you intend to work extensively with the MAN method.
